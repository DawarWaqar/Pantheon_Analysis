This repository provides a notebook that delves into the Pantheon Project [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mit/pantheon-project).

## Project Overview

The Pantheon Project by the Macro Connections Group at MIT Media Lab curates a dataset detailing the popularity of historical figures across cultures, time periods, and domains. This project focuses on processing, analyzing, and visualizing the dataset to understand the significance and popularity of various public figures.

An overview of the dataset prompted several questions that are explored in this notebook:

- What careers make a figure more popular?
- How have particular events influenced the popularity of these careers?
- What is the relationship between popularity and gender?
- What role does nationality and ethnicity play in determining popularity?
- How do wikipedia statistics affect a personâ€™s popularity?
